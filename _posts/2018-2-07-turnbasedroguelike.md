## Introduction
These posts will show the development process for a turn-based roguelike that I have decided to create for a university module. The main goal of this project is to attempt a unique style of turn-based gameplay. For the duration of this project I will mainly be focusing on the programming element, and the design thereof. The game will be developed in Unity using C#.
## The Game
The game I will be making is a fantasy roguelike, which combines hack and slash mechanics for regular enemies with simple turn-based mechanics for bosses. The game will include RPG elements, such as a party and character stats, which will have different effects in the two styles (Party members will count a lives outside of a turn based scenario). The game should play like Darkest Dungeon meets Diablo.
## The risks
The main risk I will face during the project is the fusing of two very different styles of games, and the difference in tempo. It will be important to keep the turn-based element fast paced so there is not this huge slow down when they get to a boss fight (which should be climatic). Another risk is that there are already a large amount of roguelikes on the market (e.g. Darkest Dungeon, FTL, The Binding of Issac) that are successful, my hope is that the amalgamation of mechanics will be enough to keep it unique.
## Current progress
Currently I am in the designing phase, making UML diagrams and storyboards. However due to the risks I would be taking I would create a quick prototype of the game, which has some of the main mechanics (missing the party and turn-based systems).
