## About the project
This was a group project in my second year, where another student and I were tasked with developing three prototypes for an infinate runner in one semester. Using a sprint methodology, each project took 4 weeks to complete. The development blog for this project can be found at: https://www.tumblr.com/blog/jjrwalkergamedev. My role in this project was a more general role, however I mainly focused on gameplay, art and audio. Overall I feel that the project could have been more unique, however we were worried about trying anything too different due to the time constraints.
