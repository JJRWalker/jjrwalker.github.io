## Work Experience
***AR Zombies (Student Project, solo)*** - Designed and implemented as a part of a emergent technologies
module, during this project I created a house of the dead style shooter using AR tags and a webcam. I was
responsible for the entire project but focused mainly on the core gameplay loop and design. I enjoyed this
project because it allowed me to modernise the feel of an old CRT shooter while maintaining the feel of the
gameplay.
***Hellrunner (Student Project, group)*** - Created as part of a university project designed to test how well we
worked in a group and semi professional setting. I was responsible for most of the Gameplay
programming, Audio Programming and Animations / Animation programming. This project was done in 3
initial prototype sprints and a seperate sprint for the final version.
